1) Basic Idea : to compare all differnet piano players, how they differ in 
		pitches when they play the same composition. 

2) How to implement : using music21 (a python-based toolkit for computer-aided musicology) 
- web.mit.edu/music21/doc/about/what.html
- 12/24 : I'm hoping to test at least with using Jupyter Notebook 
to see how the streaming data from microphone works (testing pyaudio).
Also hoping to capture/ store the data by playing different audios and compare the data. 
- blockers : My original plan was to get the raw data from the speaker
(or even from the microphone) but I'm not sure if I need to use 
an external soundcard to store the sound data. 
- There's a .json database available for Classicalmusic but 
I am not sure if I want to use the string data.. or even just creating a scraper. 
I'm currently more interested in real time audio data.
